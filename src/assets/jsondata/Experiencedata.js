    description: `For the past 8 months, I've been a React Native developer at Jamrio, a Bangalore-based start up company building a social media platform for creators. In the last 3 months, I've transitioned into a leadership role, taking ownership of the entire frontend development (React Native) for the platform.
    My responsibilities include:
    -Feature Development: Designing and implementing new features to enhance the user experience for creators and their audiences.
    -Bug Resolution: Proactively identifying and resolving bugs to ensure a smooth and stable platform.
    -Code Debugging: Effectively debugging complex code issues to maintain optimal performance.
    -API Implementation: Integrating new APIs to expand platform functionality and connect with external resources.
    While I collaborate with a senior developer for bi-weekly consultations, I function as the primary driver of frontend development for Jamrio. This experience has fostered my ability to work independently, manage a complex codebase, and deliver impactful results in a remote setting.`,
