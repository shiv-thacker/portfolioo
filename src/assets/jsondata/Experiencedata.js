    description: `For the past 8 months, I've been a React Native developer at Jamrio, a Bangalore-based start up company building a social media platform for creators. In the last 3 months, I've transitioned into a leadership role, taking ownership of the entire frontend development (React Native) for the platform.
    My responsibilities include:
    -Feature Development: Designing and implementing new features to enhance the user experience for creators and their audiences.
    -Bug Resolution: Proactively identifying and resolving bugs to ensure a smooth and stable platform.
